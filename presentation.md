I bring news from Switzerland

Of the Swiss Perl Workshop 2017.

There's a SPW now?

No, there has been a SPW since 2013.

And it's not in the obvious places

Like Geneva. https://www.flickr.com/photos/vipals/

Or Zurich. https://www.flickr.com/photos/lschlagenhauf/

It has been in Olten

And Innsbruck

Which is especially surprising since Innsbruck is not even in Switzerland.

This year it will be held in Villars-sur-Ollon

In the Vaud Alps, just south of Lake Geneva.

Home of GivenGain, possibly the highest altitude perl shop in the world?

What can we offer? Well of course:

Cheese

Chocolate

Wine

Whisky (ask Wendy)

Beer

Rosti

Views of a famous mountain

No, not that one (although it's not far away) https://www.flickr.com/photos/lschlagenhauf/

And if course perl

Lots of perl

Talks

Workshops

So come to Villars, 25/26 August 2017 to enjoy SPW 2017 and much much more.
